1 How to delete folder from local repo?      
        In the command-line, navigate to your local repository.
        Ensure you are in the default branch:
        git checkout master
        The rm -r command will recursively remove your folder:
        git rm -r folder-name
        Commit the change:
        git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"
        Push the change to your remote repository:
        git push origin master
2 What is Pom file?
        POM is an acronym for Project Object Model. The pom. xml file contains information of project and configuration information for the maven to build the             project such as dependencies, build directory, source directory, test source directory, plugin, goals etc

3 What does it mean to fork a Git repository?
        A fork in Git is simply a copy of an existing repository in which the new owner disconnects the codebase from previous committers. A fork often occurs when a developer becomes dissatisfied or disillusioned with the direction of a project and wants to detach their work from that of the original project.

4 How to configure auto scaling in AWS?"

go to the EC2 Dashboard, which is where you can create and manage instances.

Create Launch Configuration: Start by creating a Launch Configuration. This configuration defines the specifications of the instances that will be launched when scaling is triggered. You'll need to specify the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), instance type, security groups, key pairs, and user data if needed.

Set Up Auto Scaling Group (ASG):

Click on "Auto Scaling Groups" on the EC2 Dashboard.
Click the "Create Auto Scaling group" .
Configure the group, including selecting the Launch Configuration you created in the previous step.
Define the desired capacity, minimum and maximum instances allowed in the group.
Configure scaling policies:
Scale-out policies: Define conditions for adding instances, such as CPU utilization exceeding a certain threshold.
Scale-in policies: Define conditions for removing instances, such as CPU utilization dropping below a certain threshold.
Configure Scaling Triggers:

You can configure triggers based on CloudWatch alarms, which monitor the metrics you choose (e.g., CPU utilization, network traffic).
Create CloudWatch alarms and attach them to the ASG to trigger scaling actions.
Define Notifications (Optional):

Configure Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) to receive notifications when scaling events occur, such as instance launches or terminations.
Configure Instance Termination Policy:

Decide how instances should be selected for termination when scaling in. AWS provides several termination policies to choose from, including oldest launch configuration, closest to next billing hour, etc.
Review and Create the Auto Scaling Group:

Review all the settings and click the "Create Auto Scaling group" button to create your auto scaling group.
Monitor and Optimize:

After configuring auto scaling, regularly monitor your application's performance and adjust scaling policies as needed to optimize resource utilization.
Testing:

It's crucial to test your auto scaling configuration to ensure it behaves as expected under various conditions.
Remember that AWS provides additional features like Scheduled Scaling and Dynamic Scaling, which you can also configure depending on your specific use case.

In an interview, it's essential to emphasize your knowledge of the core concepts and practical steps involved in configuring auto scaling in AWS. Additionally, you can discuss any real-world scenarios or challenges you've encountered while implementing auto scaling to demonstrate your hands-on experience and problem-solving skills.
